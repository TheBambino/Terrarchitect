This mod adds a wide variety of custom-made, high-quality decorational items to Terraria, some of which are interactive! It also aims to make some previously ubobtainable or unplacable vanilla items available.

Whether you're a dedicated builder who wants to add more detail to his creations our you're more interested in the game's progression but still want your base to look good, this mod has something for everybody.

All new items are craftable at the newly added crafting station called "Terrarchitect Catalogue" or can be bought from various NPCs.

We want to add way more content in the future, so stay tuned!

A "cheat sheet" containing all items and how to craft or find them is available through Terrarchitect's thread on the Terraria Community Forums.
